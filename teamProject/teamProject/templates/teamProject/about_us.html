            You are thrown into a random place in Cork and you must guess where that is.
            We have 3 gamemodes: Easy ( for kids ), Retro ( for the rents or if you're feeling a bit ambitious ) and
            finally Hard mode if you're a pro!
            The Easy and Retro mode are simple MCQ games, whereas the Hard mode provides you with a map and you
            must pinpoint where you are on it.</p>
        <h1>Scoring</h1>
        <p><b>Easy + Retro Gamemode: </b>These different gaemmodes consists of 5 rounds, Multiple Choice Question ( MCQ ) based.
         You are given 20 seconds each round and depending on how many seconds are left corresponds to the
        amoung of points you will get, so you better click fast! This is presuming you got the answer right because if you didn't 
      you will get nothing.</p>
        <p><b>Hard Gamemode: </b>In this each game also consists of 5 rounds.
            The maximum amount points you can obtain each round is 150.
            Therefore the mamimum amount of points you are able to achieve is 750!!
          </p>
